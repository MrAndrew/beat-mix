# Beat Mix

This is a simple browser based drum machine that I wrote JavaScript code to get from broken to functional.

## Getting Started

To see the project in action you will need to have Node.js installed on your local machine. If you do, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the directory and run `npm install` to initialize all dependencies.
3. Then run `npm run start` to have local server start listening to a port and servin the app.
4. Finally, open `index.html` in your browser (Firefox or Chrome is recommended) to see and use the final application.

### Built With

* JavaScript - Main language requirement and altered code from start to finish.
* Node - For compiling and running code.
* Mocha - For testing purposes.

### Authors

* __CodeCademy__ - _Provided the initial starting code and instructions_ - [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
* __Mr. Andrew__ - _Wrote the overly long and complex if-else logic in `script.js`, but don't be too judgemental. He was just beginning and has left it unchanged to reflect on progress made since_ - [Mr.Andrew](https://github.com/MrAndrew7of9)
